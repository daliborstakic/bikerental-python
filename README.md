# Bike Rental System

## What I've done
I've made three Python files. One contains the GUI and the class variables and objects. One is simply an OOP definition, with two classes, Shop and Customer. The third one is a test file for the shop.py file.
The user(customer) can rent one or more bikes on three basis: hourly, daily and weekly. When they return the bikes, the bill will be calculated based on the amount of bikes, the time that has passed and the rental basis.

## What I hope to implement
Nothing much, honestly. Of course the GUI could be much sleeker but I don't feel a need to rework it in the future.
